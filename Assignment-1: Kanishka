Here, I have created a text generator with the help of transformers (GPT-2).
The app allows users to input a text prompt and generates coherent and meaningful responses in real-time.
This project involved leveraging Hugging Face's transformers library, TensorFlow, and techniques like beam search for optimal text generation.
